### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate Java programmer focusing on scalable enterprise applications, optimization of algorithms, clean code, and clean architecture.

I work as an independent developer, coach, and course instructor. 

I share my knowledge about Java, architecture, algorithms, and data structures in [videos](https://youtube.com/@HappyCoders), my [newsletter](https://www.happycoders.eu/newsletter/), and my blog [HappyCoders.eu](https://www.happycoders.eu/).
